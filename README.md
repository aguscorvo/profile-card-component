## Acknowledgments

Thanks [Irving](https://github.com/IrvingJuarez) for helping me to adjust the height of the top section of the card.

I've got some inspiration from [Sebastien Stordeur's solution](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/profile-card-component-first-attempt-NzK22HFpx) to set correctly the background images.
